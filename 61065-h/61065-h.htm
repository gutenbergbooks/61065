<h2>MODERN AMERICAN DRINKS.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<h3>Absinthe.</h3>
<p>
Absinthe is composed of the tops and leaves of the herb artemisia
absinthium, or wormwood, which contains a volatile oil, absinthol,
and a yellow, crystalline, resinous compound, called absinthin,
which is the bitter principle. The alcohol with which this is mixed
holds these volatile oils in solution.
</p>

<p>
The free use of absinthe is injurious. Never serve it in any kind
of drink unless called for by the customer.
</p>

<h3>California Style Absinthe.</h3>
<p>
A mixing-glass* half full fine ice, one jigger absinthe. Shake
until very cold, strain into thin bar-glass, fill with siphon
seltzer or carbonic.
</p>

<p class="small">* By a mixing-glass is meant a large soda-glass,
holding twelve ounces; it is handier and gives better satisfaction
than a goblet. A jigger is a measure used for measuring liquors
when mixing drinks; it holds two ounces. A pony holds half a jigger.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_020">20</span>
</p>

<h3>Dripped Absinthe.</h3>
<p class="c008">(Use Absinthe Drip-glass.)</p>
<p>
Pour one pony of absinthe into the bottom glass, fill the upper
(drip) glass full of ice-water. When two-thirds of the water has
dripped into the absinthe it is ready to be drunk. A few drops of
anisette will improve this drink.
</p>

<h3>Absinthe, Italian Style.</h3>
<p>
Put into a thin eight-ounce glass containing a few lumps of clear
ice one pony of absinthe, two dashes maraschino, four dashes
anisette. Slowly fill the glass with ice-water, stir well with long
bar-spoon. Serve.
</p>

<h3>Absinthe, Swiss Style.</h3>
<p>
Fill a mixing-glass half-full of fine ice, pour into it one pony of
absinthe, one pony of water, one dash of gum-syrup. Shake with
shaker until very cold, strain into champagne-tumbler, fill up with
siphon seltzer.
</p>

<h3>Ammonia and Seltzer.</h3>
<p>
This is a good remedy for the relief of the depression following
alcoholic excesses. Dose: Twenty drops of spirit. ammon. aromat. in
a medium-sized glass of seltzer or plain water.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_021">21</span>
</p>

little water, the juice of quarter of a lemon, fill glass half-full

well. Serve in long thin punch-glass on ice with straws. Trim with
fruit in season.
</p>

<h3>Arrack.</h3>

Arrack is made from the juice obtained from the cocoanut-tree.
There is another kind made from rice. That which is imported from
Japan is considered the best.
</p>

excellent drink if made into lemonade.
</p>

<h3>Bicarbonate of Soda.</h3>
<p>
One small bar-spoonful of bicarbonate of soda in a medium-sized
glassful of plain water or seltzer (this is an excellent
stomach-settler).
</p>

<h3>Black Stripe.</h3>
<p>
One teaspoonful molasses, one small lump ice, one jigger Jamaica,
Medford, or St. Croix rum. Mix well in small bar-glass. Serve.
</p>

<h3>Bishop.</h3>

<span class="small">SUCH AS</span><br/>
<span class="large">WATER ICES, SHERBETS, AND<br/>

<hr class="short" />

<p>
Certain distinctions have been made in water ices. The varieties

<p>
Water ices only half frozen, without stirring, and having a rough,

Frozen punches are made by adding liquor to the ices either before
